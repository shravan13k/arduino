This arduino code class is for controlling a stepper motor using an 'A4988' stepper motor driver.
It has various fumctions like assigning pins, step size, direction, speed of the motor etc.
It also solves the problem of time lag while the ardiuino is running huge chunks of code alongwith
this particular set of code, as it does not use any delay() function.
